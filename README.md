# comp-math-project
This repo contains code relating to the Fall 2018 Computational Math I group project at the Illinois Institute of Technology. We will examine properties of band matrices from a theoretical and computational perspective, focusing on the following areas in particular.
* Examining properties of the QR-factorization of band matrices
* Designing efficient algorithms which exploit properties of band matrices
* Discussing applications of such methods and of band matrices in general
